A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is developed in a network to detect threats from monitoring packets transmitted though. In this project, we implement 4 Machine Learning classifications algorithms on the NSL-KDD dataset. The dataset contains a list of Attacks and Types of Attacks.

# INTRUSION DETECTOR LEARNING
Software to detect network intrusions protects a computer network from unauthorized users, including perhaps insiders.  
The intrusion detector learning task is to build a predictive model (i.e. a classifier) capable of distinguishing between ``bad'' connections, called intrusions or attacks, and ``good'' normal connections.

Attacks fall into four main categories:
DOS: denial-of-service, e.g. syn flood;
R2L: unauthorized access from a remote machine, e.g. guessing password;
U2R:  unauthorized access to local superuser (root) privileges, e.g., various ``buffer overflow'' attacks;
probing: surveillance and other probing, e.g., port scanning.
